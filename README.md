# interstasis-paper
A repository containing the code for Faraway et al. (2025).

The GeRM package, used in this work to score Generalised RNA Multivalency, is available at: [https://github.com/ulelab/germ](https://github.com/ulelab/germ).

The code for computing the binding potential of RBPs based on *in vitro* motifs is available in **Bind-N-Seq_BindingPotentialAnalysis/**.  
Input data and output files are deposited on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15682421) due to their large size.

The code for training a random forest model to predict nuclear retention of endogenous transcripts upon induction of R-MCD is available in **RandomForestModel/**.  
Input data and output files are deposited on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15682421) due to their large size.
